# Facials
If you've ever felt overwhelmed and/or confused by the sheer number of skin treatments (been there), allow us to help you wade the waters. See, facials are an investment—of both time and money. So before booking just any treatment, it's important to know which option is best for your skin type and concern. Granted, there are a ton of spa services out there, but this guide will help you navigate any menu. All [facials](https://greenreliefmd.com/facials-baltimore/) will follow a similar form—steam, exfoliate, extract, massage, hydrate, etc.—with some added treatments or tools thrown in, depending on your skin's individual needs. For example, an esthetician performing an acne facial might spend more time on extractions, whereas a lymphatic facial would involve more massage work.
